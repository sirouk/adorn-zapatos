# Adorn Zapatos

The script is meant to run without arguments:

`./adorn_zapatos.sh`

For now the script has selective commands enabled for renaming, as this is still a WIP.

When you run this, you will end up with the repos that are to be renamed within this repo's directory.


Shout out to my mentors! 🙏
