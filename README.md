# Adorn Zapatos

The script is meant to run without arguments:

`./adorn_zapatos.sh`

When you run this, you will end up with the target repos to be renamed within this repo's directory.

After execution, you will find logs for renaming and testing inside those repo subfolders.

Log file naming convention:
`adorn_zapatos_changelog-rename-[reponame].log`
`adorn_zapatos_changelog-testing-[reponame].log`

The script has selective commands enabled for renaming, as this is still a WIP.

Thanks to the folks who helped me get it to this point! üôè
